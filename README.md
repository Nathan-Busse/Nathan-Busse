My moto in life is "Make the impossible Possible" and Wish it dream it do it AND prove people wrong if it come by dissabality!

I am a student well more of a Nerd who is addicted to programming.
I spend most of my freetime when I am not doing schoolwork or anything else, infront of my computer programming a crazy project I thought of the night before
in my sleep. I am so facinated in programming I dream in it.

My dream is to become a Software Engineer and Mechtronics Engineer and start my own tech compony.
Once I have forfilled my dream I would like to further my knowledge and continue my studies improving my vast knowledge of computers.

I am a self-taught programmer who wants to use his gift to change the world one line at a time. 
Everything I know of computers from hardware to programming I taught myself with no-ones help, that is why I see myself as my own role model.

I have a motto that I follow by, which is:
Wish it, Dream it and Do it.
