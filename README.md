My name is Nathan

### About Myself.

Since I was still very young, I was fascinated by technology especially software, robotics, Artificial Intelligence and space exploration. 
I started programming back in 2014 when I was 11 with my Raspberry PI Model B+.

I am fisuale impared, the reason for that was that i was 3 months prematured.
, blind in my left eye  in in my right eye -14.  i will never be able to drive a car.
this doesnt stop me, because I dont believe in the word... I cant!
My moto in life is "Make the impossible Possible" and Wish it dream it do it AND prove people wrong if it come by dissabality!

I am a student well more of a Nerd who is addicted to programming.
I spend my freetime when I am not doing schoolwork or anything else, infront of my computer programming a crazy project I thought of the night before
in my sleep. I am so facinated in programming I dream in it.

My dream is to become a Software Engineer, Game developer and Mechtronics Engineer and start my own tech compony that will change the world.
Once I have forfilled my dream I would like to further my knowledge and continue my studies improving my vast knowledge of computers.

I am a self-taught programmer who wants to use his gift to change the world one line at a time. 
Everything I know of computers from hardware to programming I taught myself with no-ones help, that is why I see myself as my own role model.

### My first incounter with programming

My first time I actually got into the world of programming was when I was 10 years old where I would mess with the Terminal on my computer.
My first project I ever made was the MeArm robot operated by an Arduino Uno. 
My first official language I have learnt was c++.

### Why I love programming

The reason why I love programming so mutch is the things you can learn and to see your creations come to life.
Programming is a world of imagination and creativity and is the Marvel universe of the modern world.
Programming is not only used for entertainment, communication or for any electronic device. It is used to save lives.
From a simple algarithm that can pradict a crime that is about to take place and inform the authorities before it occurs.
Bomb disposal robots used to risk their circuits to save the lives of 100s if not thousands.
Lets not forget about the software used for medical purposes to discover new deseases and develop cures.

Then their is github the software that joins millions of programmers into a community where ideas can be shared and can collaberate with one another,
teaching us new things everyday, that is why I love github.

I have a motto that I follow by, which is:
Wish it, Dream it and Do it.
