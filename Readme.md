# Hello, world!

My name is Nathan

### About Myself.

I am a Nerd  who has a passion for inventing and programming that will change the world for the good of the planet and all life it harbours.

My mission is to save this planet, it is our home amd will do my best for Earth's survival and not abandon it, one line at a time...

### Why I love programming

The reason why I love programming so mutch is the things you can learn and to see your creations come to life.
Programming is a world of imagination and creativity and is the Marvel universe of the modern world.
Programming is not only used for entertainment, communication or for any electronic device. It is used to save lives.
From a simple algarithm that can pradict a crime that is about to take place and inform the authorities before it occurs.
Bomb disposal robots used to risk their circuits to save the lives of 100s if not thousands.
Lets not forget about the software used for medical purposes to discover new deseases and develop cures.

Then their is github the software that joins millions of programmers into a community where ideas can be shared and can collaberate with one another,
teaching us new things everyday, that is why I love github.

I have a motto that I follow by, which is:
Wish it, Dream it and Do it.
